                    <h3>Where The Body Rests</h3>
                    <br>

                    <p>Allah! Forgive our living and our dead, those of us who are present and those who are absent, our
                        young and our old, our males and our females. O! .... Allah is Great.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our skin has turned to parchment Our skin has turned to parchment Our skin are the scrolls upon which
                        This history will be written</p>
                    
                    <p>When your skin becomes phosphorous Speckled, yellow and scorched <br>
                        Each cell is a star, constellations Flung upwards to create a new sky</p>
                    
                    <p>When your skin is shredded <br>
                        Pounded to dust, you are not dead You are instead ground into the earth Fertile and ready to plant</p>
                    
                    <p>When your body detaches leaving <br>
                        Pieces of itself on the road <br> 
                        Eyes are tiny pebbles the fist<br>
                        A pine cone, corpuscles of Indian paintbrush</p>

                    <p>The deaths of innocents are not buried</p>

                    <p>Or easily disposed of, no cloth can <br>
                        Wrap us tightly, no coffin an impenetrable Shell. We are not dust but<br>
                        The mark is on the earth, the vapors<br>
                        Are in the sky, the arteries of the heart<br>
                        Are the rivers and streams, our hair waterfalls. We are clouds and boulders, brush and willow.</p>

                    <p>Our skin has turned to parchment Our skin has turned to parchment Our skin are the scrolls upon which
                        This history will be written</p>

                    <h3>Letters From Home</h3>
                    <h4>To my father</h4>

                    <p>Every time you weep, I feel the surface of a river <br>
                        somewhere on Earth is breaking.<br>
                        You wipe your eyes as you read<br>
                        aloud a letter from the old country.<br>
                        From the floor, I watch the curls of the words<br>
                        through the sheer pages.<br>
                        Your brother and sisters have gathered<br>
                        around you. I donâ€™t understand<br>
                        the language but feel a single breath<br>
                        of grief holding this room.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your mother writes of her weakening body. <br>
                        She walks to church but cannot leave<br>
                        the village. When you sat with her,<br>
                        You wanted her forgiveness for your absence<br>
                        but did not ask. She took you to her closet<br>
                        to show you the linens she had gathered<br>
                        which have already yellowed. Her hands<br>
                        seemed small through the lace. You kissed<br>
                        her palms, smelling your own fragrance on her skin</p>

                    <p>She tells you of the refuge people have found <br>
                        in the village. Others have gone to Paris.<br>
                        You have a niece who is a doctor,<br>
                        a nephew, an architect. Your own children<br>
                        seem like nomads. They sit in scattered apartments<br>
                        where you can't see your three daughters<br>
                        gazing from their windows or your three sons<br>
                        pacing the old wood of their rooms.<br>
                        Yet you write to your mother,<br>
                        they still pray.
                        </p>
                    
                    <p>You visit your mother now when you can. <br>
                        Each summer you cross the Mediterranean;<br>
                        each summer you stand behind her house<br>
                        looking into the sea hoping she will not die,<br>
                        this time. And when these letters come,<br>
                        I run my finger across the pages.<br>
                        I hope I can learn the languages<br>
                        you have come to know.</p>

                    <h3>I Am With Those Who Are Free</h3>

                    <p>I am with the prisoners<br>
                        whose cells are drowned in darkness,<br>
                        I am with the broken-hearted,<br>
                        with those who lost their way.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>I am with the shackled hands, <br>
                        with the eyes longing for the sky,<br>
                        with the lips thirsting for freedom,<br>
                        with the souls that never yield.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am with those who dream<br>
                        of land unscarred by war,<br>
                        of olive trees that stand tall,<br>
                        of laughter unburdened by grief.
                        </p>

                    <p>I am with those who refuse to kneel,<br>
                        who write their names in the wind,<br>
                        who plant their feet into the earth<br>
                        and say: We are here. We will remain.</p>

                <p>These poems are not written out of inspiration or creativity, they are lived and reported. They showcase
                    the harsh reality of war and they carry the weight of tomorrow. They carve stories from memories into
                    pages we can appreciate and live through. In these poems, love and war share the same breath, and
                    longing is stitched into the fabric of every word. These women told stories many failed to verbalize and
                    shaped poetry for centuries to come.</p>
